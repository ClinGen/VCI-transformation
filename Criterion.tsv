PVS1	null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical ±1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multiexon deletion) in a gene where LOF is a known mechanism of disease	Null Variant in known LOF genes	CG:VS	Very Strong	LN:LA6668-3	Pathogenic	The two main concerns for applying this rule is: a. Is LOF an established disease mechanism? b. Is LOF actually occurring?	
PS1	Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change	same as previous pathogenic amino acid change	CG:S	Strong	LN:LA6668-3	Pathogenic	Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level From CSER paper: One site erroneously used this to apply prior publication of the same exact variant while this rule, as described in more depth on the ACMG/AMP guideline, only applies when the established pathogenic variant has a different nucleotide change than the variant being interpreted.	
PS2	De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history	confirmed de novo no family history	CG:S	Strong	LN:LA6668-3	Pathogenic	MYH7 is adding specificity to this rule with a. No family history = parents have had ECHO and ECG b. Only paternity confirmation required	
PS3	Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product	well-established damaging effect functional studies	CG:S	Strong	LN:LA6668-3	Pathogenic	This particular rule will probably be downgraded often, given that there are not many “Functional studies that have been validated and shown to be reproducible and robust in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting”	
PS4	The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared with the prevalence in controls	Prevelance increase in affected v control	CG:S	Strong	LN:LA6668-3	Pathogenic		
PM1	Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g., active site of an enzyme) without benign variation	Located in hot spot w/out benign variation	CG:M	Moderate	LN:LA6668-3	Pathogenic	Suggested that this rule is NOT appropriate for LOF variants. Also, note that when the region of interest is a “well-established functional domain” then it’s not necessary to show through evidence that it is intolerant of benign missense variants.  However, when a mutational hotspot is being defined, then showing it does not have benign missense variants is important.	
PM2	Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) (Table 6) in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium	Absent from controls	CG:M	Moderate	LN:LA6668-3	Pathogenic	Some groups are allowing to rule to be used if even not 100% absent For instance, Cardio has allowed PM2 to be used if MAF is <0.05% with 95% CI if CI lower is ~0.00% (at 2 decimal places) AND CI upper is below 0.05%  Caveat: Population data for insertions/deletions may be poorly called by next-generation sequencing	/user/acmg/pm2.md
PM3	For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant	Recessive in trans w/ Path	CG:M	Moderate	LN:LA6668-3	Pathogenic	CSER - Laboratories discussed when to modify the strength of PM3, the variant is seen in trans with a pathogenic variant for recessive disorders. Published literature may not always explicitly state the phase of variants found in affected individuals which raises a challenge for invoking PM3. When phase has not been established, some felt that PM3 could be invoked as supporting evidence. Also, if the variant is seen in trans with a pathogenic variant in more than one individual it was felt that PM3 can be upgraded to strong. However, sites did not agree on how many additional observations were necessary to call the evidence strong (2 vs. 3) but concluded that such guidance would be useful.   LMM - INCREASES IN STRENGTH IF VARIANT SEEN IN MULTIPLE COMPOUND HETS WITH DIFFERENT LIKELY PATHOGENIC/PATHOGENIC VARIANTS 	
PM4	Protein length changes as a result of in-frame deletions/insertions in a nonrepeat region or stop-loss variants	Protein length changes or stop-loss	CG:M	Moderate	LN:LA6668-3	Pathogenic	Need to ensure that variant is not located within a repeat region  This rule is also (likely) applicable for frameshift variants that result in extension of the protein as opposed to truncation (similar to stop loss).	
PM5	Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before	novel missense at same aa residue as known path missense	CG:M	Moderate	LN:LA6668-3	Pathogenic	Need to be sure that pathogenic variant exists at the residue in question. Sometimes discrepancy resolution may be required. Some thing like Variantexplorer.org may be useful. Sometimes no assertion is provided in ClinVar ...may require curation by lit. search.	
PM6	Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity	assumed de novo	CG:M	Moderate	LN:LA6668-3	Pathogenic		
PP1	Cosegregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease	segregates with disease in affected family members	CG:P	Supporting	LN:LA6668-3	Pathogenic		
PP2	Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and in which missense variants are a common mechanism of disease	missense with pathogenic missense common	CG:P	Supporting	LN:LA6668-3	Pathogenic	Seems no one has established firm rules for when this rule is applicable so not sure how great any examples will be Agree with the lack of firm rules. Seems like one criteria may be observed missense variants over 5% allele frequency in ExAC. If this seems reasonable then I could generate a couple of examples.	
PP3	Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.)	computational evidence supports deleterious effect	CG:P	Supporting	LN:LA6668-3	Pathogenic	Don’t know if there is a definition of “multiple” . If >1 then the algorithms chosen are at the discretion of the curator/lab.  There is a difference between lines of evidence and number of implementations.	
PP4	Patient’s phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology	disease specific phenotype and family history	CG:P	Supporting	LN:LA6668-3	Pathogenic		
PP5	Reputable source recently reports variant as pathogenic, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation	pathogenic from reputable source without shared data	CG:P	Supporting	LN:LA6668-3	Pathogenic		
BA1	Allele frequency is >5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium	present in population databases at greater than 5%	CG:A	Stand-Alone	LN:LA6675-8	Benign	Several groups have lowered the BA1 threshold (e.g. PTEN-1%). Also the sequence variant interpretation group is working on a modified version of this guideline including the minimum # of alleles that need to be examined and the population stratification effects, if any.	
BS1	Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder	MAF too high for disorder	CG:S	Strong	LN:LA6675-8	Benign		
BS2	Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age	control frequency higher than penetrance predicts	CG:S	Strong	LN:LA6675-8	Benign	This rule should not be used for diseases with reduced penetrance or late/variable age of  onset (such as certain cardiomyopathies).	
BS3	Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing	well-established no damaging effect functional studies	CG:S	Strong	LN:LA6675-8	Benign	 This will all depend on what is “established”, which could end up being defined by the different clinical domain working groups. 	
BS4	Lack of segregation in affected members of a family	does not segregate with disease	CG:S	Strong	LN:LA6675-8	Benign	This rule is for “lack of segregation” meaning phenotype positive / genotype negative (and not pheno neg / geno pos). Also need to be careful of phenocopies. Also need rules for how many cases are needed in use this rule	
BP1	Missense variant in a gene for which primarily truncating variants are known to cause disease	missense variant when truncating is pathogenic 	CG:P	Supporting	LN:LA6675-8	Benign	Is there any guidance on the proportion of pathogenic variants that are LOF to apply this rule?  99%? 90%? 75%?	
BP2	Observed in trans with a pathogenic variant for a fully penetrant dominant gene/disorder or observed in cis with a pathogenic variant in any inheritance pattern	in trans with dominant OR in cis with path variant	CG:P	Supporting	LN:LA6675-8	Benign		
BP3	In-frame deletions/insertions in a repetitive region without a known function	in-frame indel unknown function	CG:P	Supporting	LN:LA6675-8	Benign		
BP4	Multiple lines of computational evidence suggest no impact on gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.)	computational evidence for no gene impact	CG:P	Supporting	LN:LA6675-8	Benign		
BP5	Variant found in a case with an alternate molecular basis for disease	alternate cause of disease	CG:P	Supporting	LN:LA6675-8	Benign		
BP6	Reputable source recently reports variant as benign, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation	benign from reputable source without shared data	CG:P	Supporting	LN:LA6675-8	Benign		
BP7	A synonymous (silent) variant for which splicing prediction algorithms predict no impact to the splice consensus sequence nor the creation of a new splice site AND the nucleotide is not highly conserved	silent variant no splicing  impact  and low conservation	CG:P	Supporting	LN:LA6675-8	Benign
